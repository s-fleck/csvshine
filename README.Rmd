![shed](inst/img/shed.png)


A minimal, eye-friendly csv editor made with
[shiny](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny),
[rhandsontable](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rhandsontable), and
[readr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr). Shed is designed to quickly
edit small (hundreds of rows) csv files and `data.frames` and save them as UTF-8
encoded csv files.


Why use shed?
-------------
Use shed if you need to manually edit csv files in a GUI, but you cannot or do
not want to install a dedicated csv-editor (for example, on a remote RStudio
server). Shed is arguably more confortable and safe to use than Excel which is
notorious for converting everything that looks remotely like a date to strangely
formatted dates. It cannot compete with dedicated csv editors in terms of
performance and can only handle csv files with a few hundred to a thousand
rows before it becomes noticably slugish.


Development status
------------------
shed is perfectly usable and the internals are more or less stable. The user
interface might still change a bit, especially how files are read and written.
There is also an 
[issue in rhandsontable](https://github.com/jrowen/rhandsontable/issues/264) 
which I want to see fixed - or figure out a workaround for - before I plan on
putting shed on CRAN.

If you have any feature requests or comments don't hesitate to file an issue
or send a mail.


## Installation

You can install shed from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("s-fleck/shed")
```


## Example

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
shed(iris)

# Uppon termination, shed returns the edited data.frame

x <- shed(iris)
```
